description: Run backend tests only
---

Run the backend test suite:

1. Navigate to the backend directory
2. Run `yarn test` to execute all backend tests
3. Analyze the results and provide:
   - Test summary (passed/failed/total)
   - Coverage report
   - Details of any failing tests
   - Suggestions for improvements

If tests fail, help debug and fix the issues.
