description: Initial project setup - install dependencies for both backend and frontend
---

Please perform the initial project setup:

1. Check the project structure to identify backend and frontend directories
2. Install backend dependencies using `yarn install` in the backend directory
3. Install frontend dependencies using `yarn install` in the frontend directory
4. Check for .env.example files and remind me to configure environment variables
5. Verify that all necessary configuration files exist (tsconfig.json, package.json, etc.)
6. Check if database migrations need to be run
7. Provide a summary of the setup completion and any action items needed

After setup, inform me about:
- Required environment variables that need to be configured
- Next steps to run the development servers
- Any missing dependencies or configuration issues
