description: Review current code changes using git diff
---

Perform a comprehensive code review of current changes:

1. Run `git status` to see what files have been modified
2. Run `git diff` to see the actual changes
3. Analyze the changes for:
   - Code quality and best practices
   - Potential bugs or issues
   - TypeScript type safety
   - i18n compliance (no hardcoded text)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Test coverage for new code
   - Performance implications
4. Provide constructive feedback with specific suggestions

Use the code-reviewer agent's perspective to ensure thorough review.
