description: Run frontend tests only

Run the frontend test suite:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory
2. Run `yarn test` to execute all frontend tests
3. Analyze the results and provide:
   - Test summary (passed/failed/total)
   - Coverage report
   - Details of any failing tests
   - Component test results
   - Suggestions for improvements

If tests fail, help debug and fix the issues.
