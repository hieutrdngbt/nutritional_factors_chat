description: Build both backend and frontend for production
---

Build the entire project for production:

1. Run `yarn build` in the backend directory
2. Run `yarn build` in the frontend directory
3. Verify that build artifacts are created successfully
4. Check the build output for:
   - Any errors or warnings
   - Bundle sizes
   - Optimization opportunities
5. Report on build success/failure

If the build fails:
- Identify the root cause
- Provide specific error details
- Suggest fixes for the issues
- Help resolve the problems
